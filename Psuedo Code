The goal is to create a stop watch that users can start, pause, and stop.

1. Create a component for all three functions
2. Create a class component for the watch do be made in
3. Within the constructor props add this.state for our timer objects array
4. Within the state we are going to set our timer to it's default state. "timerOn: false,timerStart: 0, timerTime: 0"
5. We know the user will need to buttons to use this app. In the return section create buttons for start, pause, and stop.
6. We also know we're going to need an on-click for our buttons. But how will we make the button work.
7. Create a function for each feature. my start function will called startTimer
8. with the helpof setStat we will set timerOn to true because this is where/when the time actually starts
